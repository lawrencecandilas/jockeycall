Update the .xml file with information relevant to your already-running
Icecast server, such as source password, etc.

- If you are not familiar with Icecast, and/or don't have a working Icecast
  server yet, you should get that up and running before continuing with
  jockeycall.

The <intake> and <metadata> sections should be left alone.

The binaries in those sections should be symlinks to the jockeycall.pl
executable.  If ezstream complains about not being able to find it, you may
need to specify the absolute path to jockeycall.pl.

The jockeycall executable will take appropriate action based on the name of
the executable and the value of the JOCKEYCALL_CHANNEL environment variable.

That environment variable can be set by you or more easily by issuing a
"jockeycall.pl transmit /path/to/channel" command.

The whole scheme is needed because ezstream won't let the intake or metadata
programs take command line arguments.
