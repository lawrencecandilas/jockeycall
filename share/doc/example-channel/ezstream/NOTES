Update the .xml file with information relevant to your already-running
Icecast server, such as source password, etc.

The <intake> and <metadata> sections should be left alone.  The binaries
those sections reference are here; they are symlinks that point to the main
jockeycall executable.

The jockeycall executable will take appropriate action based on the name of
the executable and the value of the JOCKEYCALL_CHANNEL environment variable.
That environment variable can be set by you or more easily by issuing a
"jockeycall.pl transmit /path/to/channel" command.

The whole scheme is needed because ezstream won't let the intake or metadata
programs take command line arguments.
